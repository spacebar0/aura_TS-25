## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant magenta (#FF00FF) to capture the bright, neon aesthetic of the interface, reflecting a high-end and immersive experience. 
- Background color: Deep charcoal (#1A1A1A), a dark and immersive backdrop that highlights the bright neon accents and cinematic feel. This color is very close to black (0,0,0) but has a hint of saturation to avoid appearing flat.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8A2BE2) to complement the magenta primary color, adding contrast and depth while maintaining a cohesive visual theme. This color amplifies the futuristic and premium feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, giving the app a techy and scientific feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Neon-glowing icons with a minimalist design to enhance the premium look, each reflecting the specific function it represents. The iconography should appear modern, crisp, and well-spaced for clarity and aesthetic appeal.
- Full-screen layout with a controller-navigable grid system. Implement 3D bento boxes for game/app tiles with subtle neon edges and scaling animations on hover. Use parallax backgrounds with midground and foreground elements moving at varying speeds to enhance depth. Apply glassmorphism to menu and overlay panels.
- Cinematic transitions utilizing smooth, camera-like pans between sections. Employ the Aura Beam loading animation which includes sweeping particles, light bloom, and a fade-in chime. Incorporate subtle scaling animations on hover for game/app tiles to make the interface interactive.
